// 1. constant in javascript ==> constant is used to declare a variable that can't be changed throughout the program.

// how to declare it? ==> using const keyword.

// const rollNumber= 99; //basic syntax to declare a constant variable.
// console.log(rollNumber); //99

//const rollNumber =150; //error ==> redeclaration of constant variable is not allowed.
//console.log(rollNumber);

//rollNumber =15; //error ==> reassigning the value to constant variable is not allowed.
// that means constant is a block scope variable that can't be changed throughout the program.

// 2. let in javascript ==> let is used to declare a variable that can be changed throughout the program.
// how to declare it? ==> using let keyword.

//let studentName ="Vikas"; //basic syntax to declare a let variable.

//let studentName ="Vikas Kumar"; //error ==> redeclaration of let variable is not allowed.

// studentName= "GeeksforGeeks";
// console.log(studentName);  //GeeksforGeeks
